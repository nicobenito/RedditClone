Reddit Top Clone using React JS

## Overview

A simple Reddit Top clone using React JS and Bootstrap. Finished on almost 5 hours.

## Instructions

* `npm install` to installed required dependencies.
* `npm start` to start the server.

## Project status
The project was accomplished on a 5 hours lapse. The main functionalities and interaction between components were achieved and tested. The post is displayed on a responsive view with the possibility to be selected for a detailed view. Also, posts can be removed from the list and are marked when user clicks on them for larger display. 

### issues

The Reddit API was not included on this development. There was a 404 error today when registering. Instead I used the json files from resources to achieve posts creation.

### Process

In order to go as further as possible on the time available, I read the complete task first, then I wrote down the possible sub-tasks and project structure. <br>
I wrote the tasks that I though should be prioritized as the post listing and selection:

* create project structure
* add parent component
* add Post List component
* fetch data from API (JSON file on the result)
* create Post component and iterate on Post List using API data
* add some style to shape views
* add select post functionality to display on larger view
* add delete button for posts
* add distinction mark when post was visited
* add more style on views
